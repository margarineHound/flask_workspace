# Flask Tutorial Files

This repository contains files used for practice as outlined in [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

Files will be added as I progress through the tutorial.
I do not claim authorship of the source material, and indemify myself against the accuracy and veracity of any and all issues that may arise from the public's usage of these files
